# CosmosGNU
**A project made for replicating GNU functionality for Cosmos.**
### We are planning to implement following features:
- all C# implementations of GNU commands and their usage 🌩️
- Own GCC-like program to compile C code and ability to execute compiled code 🤔
- It's own shell (exactly like bash, but not bash) ⚾
- Updated DotNetParser (will be added a lot of methods) 🐈‍⬛
- Maybe updated FAT32 driver or added new like EXT4 driver (i... i don't think we can do that) 🙉
